            <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
            <p>Modern operating systems provide mechanisms to produce text in a variety of ways: speech-to-text, virtual keyboards, handwriting recognition and many more.  When an app wants to consume text input from these various sources, it must first provide a view of its currently editable text to the operating system.  The view of editable text provides a common language that apps (having a variety of different document models) and sources of text (having a variety of different input methods) can both understand.  Both the apps and input sources communicate with one another by expressing their desired changes to the state of the common view as an event that the other can handle to facilitate the text input process.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of this document, a producer of text is known as a <dfn>Text Input Method</dfn>.  The view provided by an app which wants to consume text is called a <dfn>Text Edit Context</dfn>.  The service provided by the OS to facilitate the editing of text in the [=Text Edit Context=] by the [=Text Input Methods=] is called a <dfn>Text Input Service</dfn>.</p>
            <figure id="many-input-methods">
                <img src="images/many-input-methods.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>Many [=Text Input Methods=] using a [=Text Input Service=] to communicate with many apps through their [=Text Edit Contexts=].</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Here’s a typical flow for the text input process in more detail:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A user places focus into an editable region of the app.</li>
                <li>The app produces a [=Text Edit Context=] describing its editable region according to the standards set forth by the [=Text Input Service=] and provides that [=Text Edit Context=] to the [=Text Input Service=].</li>
                <li>The [=Text Input Service=] triggers a [=Text Input Method=] to provide some user interface for capturing text input from the user and provides the [=Text Input Method=] the app generated [=Text Edit Context=].</li>
                <li>The [=Text Input Method=] reads the location of selection and nearby text from the [=Text Edit Context=] to help tailor its user experience.</li>
                <li>The [=Text Input Method=] may also read screen coordinates for where the selection and editable region are located so that it can properly position its user interface next to the text being edited.</li>
                <li>The user interacts with the [=Text Input Method=] user interface to input text in some [=Text Input Method=]-specific way.</li>
                <li>The [=Text Input Method=] describes its desired modifications to the text and selection in the [=Text Edit Context=] in response to the user’s input.</li>
                <li>The app handles an event describing the desired modifications to its [=Text Edit Context=] and renders the result to the user.</li>
            </ol>
            <figure id="text-input-process">
                <img src="images/text-input-process.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>A sequence diagram illustrating a typical flow for text input.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Existing user agents handle the details of this text input process so that the author’s responsibility ends at declaring what elements of the document represent an editable region.  Authors express which regions are editable using input elements, textarea elements, contenteditable elements, or by setting the designMode attribute to true to mark an entire document as editable. </p>
            <p>As an editable region of the document is <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focused">focused</a>, the user agent automatically produces the [=Text Edit Context=] from the contents of the editable region and the position of the selection within it.  When a [=Text Input Method=] produces text, the user agent translates the events against its [=Text Edit Context=] into a set of DOM and style modifications – only some of which are described using existing events that an author can handle. </p>
            <p>Authors that want to produce sophisticated editing experiences may be challenged by the current approach.  If, for example, the text and selection are rendered to a canvas, user agents are unable to produce a [=Text Edit Context=] to drive the text input process.  Authors compensate by resorting to offscreen editable elements, but this approach comes with negative implications for accessibility, it deteriorates the input experience, and requires complex code to synchronize the position of the text in the offscreen editable element with the corresponding text in the canvas. </p>
            <p>With the introduction of this EditContext API, authors can more directly participate in the protocol for text input and avoid the pitfalls described above.</p>

        <section id="editcontext-model">
            <h3>The EditContext Model</h3>
            <p>
                The [=Text Input Service=] and [=Text Edit Context=] are abstractions representing the common aspects of text input across many operating systems.
                An {{EditContext}} is a JavaScript reflection of the [=Text Edit Context=]. 
                When changes are made to the [=Text Edit Context=] by the [=Text Input Service=], those changes are reflected to the author asynchronously in the form of events which are dispatched against the [=active EditContext=].
                When the author makes changes to the [=active EditContext=], those changes will be reflected in the [=Text Edit Context=] during the next lifecycle update.
            </p>
            <h4>EditContext state</h4>
            <p>
                Both the [=Text Edit Context=] and {{EditContext}} have a [=text state=] which holds the information exchanged in the aforementioned updates. The <dfn>text state</dfn> consists of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><dfn>text</dfn> which is a {{DOMString}} representing editable content. The initial value is the empty string.</li>
                <li><dfn>selection start</dfn> which refers to the offset in [=text=] where the selection starts. The initial value is 0.</li>
                <li><dfn>selection end</dfn> which refers to the offset in [=text=] where the selection ends. The initial value is 0. [=selection end=] must always be greater than or equal to [=selection start=].</li>
                <li><dfn>is composing</dfn> which indicates if there is an active composition. The initial value is false.</li>
                <li><dfn>composition start</dfn> which refers to the offset in [=text=] representing the start position of the text being actively composed. The initial value is 0.</p></li>
                <li><dfn>composition end</dfn> which refers to the offset in [=text=] representing the end position of the text being actively composed. The initial value is 0. [=composition end=] must always be greater than or equal to [=composition start=].</li>
                <li><dfn>text formats</dfn> which is an array of [=text format=]. The array is initially empty.</li>
                <li><dfn>control bounds</dfn> is a rectangle describing the area of the screen in which [=text=] is displayed.  It is in the [=client coordinate=] system and the initial x, y, width, and height all 0.</li>
                <li><dfn>selection bounds</dfn> is the rectangle describing the position of selection. It is in the [=client coordinate=] system and the initial x, y, width, and height are all 0.</li>
                <li><dfn>codepoint locations</dfn> which is an array of [=codepoint location=]. The array is initially empty.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><dfn>text format</dfn> is a struct that indicates decorative properties that should be applied to the ranges of [=text=].  The struct contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><dfn>range start</dfn> which is an offset into [=text=] that respresents the position before the first codepoint that should be decorated.</li>
                <li><dfn>range end</dfn> which is an offset into [=text=] that respresents the position after the last codepoint that should be decorated.</li>
                <li><dfn>underline style</dfn>, a {{UnderlineStyle}} which is the preferred underline style of the decorated [=text=] range.</li>
                <li><dfn>underline thickness</dfn>, a {{UnderlineThickness}} which is the preferred underline thickness of the decorated [=text=] range.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><dfn>codepoint location</dfn> is a struct that captures the location (in [=client coordinate=]s) of codepoints from [=text=].  Each struct represents a contigious run of codepoints starting at an offset within [=text=] indicated by [=start index=].  The struct contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><dfn>start index</dfn> which is an offset into [=text=] that respresents the position before the first codepoint whose location is reported by the first member of [=codepoint rects=] array.</li>
                <li><dfn>codepoint rects</dfn> is an array of {{DOMRect}} defining the bounding box of each codepoint.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
                [=Codepoint locations=] provides the means for the user agent to query multiple ranges of [=text=] for positioning information.
                Different platforms may require different positions to be cached to fulfill queries from the [=Text Input Service=] and this API shape allows for that flexibility.
                It would be good if the API could be simplified to require just the positions of the actively composed text along with the [=selection bounds=] and [=control bounds=].
                Exploration is needed to see if that is possible.
            </p>
            <h4>Association and activation</h4>
            <p>
                An {{EditContext}} has an <dfn data-for="edit-context">associated element</dfn>, an {{HTMLElement}}.
                An element becomes an {{EditContext}}'s <a>associated element </a>by assigning
                the {{EditContext}} to the element's {{HTMLElement/editContext}} property.
                An {{HTMLElement}} can be <a data-lt="associated element">associated</a> with at most one {{EditContext}}.
            </p>
            <p class="note">
              An {{EditContext}} keeps its [=associated element=] alive, so developers
              should be aware that assigning an {{EditContext}} to an element's
              {{HTMLElement/editContext}} property will prevent the element from being garbage
              collected until the property is cleared or the {{EditContext}} is garbage collected.
            </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                If an {{EditContext}}'s <a>associated element</a>'s parent is not
                <a href="https://w3c.github.io/editing/docs/execCommand/#editable">editable</a>,
                then the <a>associated element</a> becomes an <dfn class="export">EditContext editing host</dfn>.
                An <a>EditContext editing host</a> is a type of [=editing host=] whose behaviors
                are described in [[[#edit-context-differences]]].
            </p>
            <div class="note">
                <p>
                    There are a couple implications of this. Firstly, if an element that is already
                    an [=editing host=] due to [^html-global/contenteditable^]
                    becomes an {{EditContext}}'s <a>associated element</a>, then that element
                    becomes an <a>EditContext editing host</a>. In other words, if both {{EditContext}}
                    and [^html-global/contenteditable^] are set on an element, the EditContext
                    behavior "wins".
                </p>
                <p>
                    Secondly, if an element is
                    <a href="https://w3c.github.io/editing/docs/execCommand/#editable">editable</a>
                    but not an [=editing host=] (i.e. it is a child in the subtree of an
                    [=editing host=]), then becoming an {{EditContext}}'s <a>associated element</a>
                    has no effect on that element. This is analogous to the behavior of
                    [^html-global/contenteditable^], where setting [^html-global/contenteditable^]
                    to "<code>true</code>" on an
                    <a href="https://w3c.github.io/editing/docs/execCommand/#editable">editable</a>
                    element that is not an [=editing host=] has no effect. Taken together, these
                    rules imply that an editable tree of nodes will follow either the
                    {{EditContext}} behavior or non-{{EditContext}} behavior, but the behaviors
                    cannot be mixed.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                A {{Document}} has an <dfn>active EditContext</dfn>, which may be null.
            </p>
            <p class="issue">
                The following paragraph can be removed once the behavior change lands
                in [[input-events]].
            </p>
            <p>
                When an [=EditContext editing host=] receives text input from the
                [=Text Input Service=], as the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#default-action">default action</a> for the
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#event-type-beforeinput">beforeinput</a>
                event fired as a result of that input the user agent must run
                [=Handle Input for EditContext=] given the [=EditContext editing host=] .
            </p>
            <h4 id="edit-context-differences">Differences for an EditContext editing host</h4>
            <p>
                <p>
                    In many ways, an <a>EditContext editing host</a> behaves in the same way as other types of [=editing host=], 
                    e.g. for a [^html-global/contenteditable^] element. Notable similarities include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each child node of the <a>EditContext editing host</a> becomes <a href="https://w3c.github.io/editing/docs/execCommand/#editable">editable</a>,
                        unless that node has a [^html-global/contenteditable^] attribute set to "<code>false</code>".
                    </li>
                    <li>The user agent handles focus and caret navigation for any editable element in the <a>EditContext editing host</a>.</li>
                    <li>
                        The <a>EditContext editing host</a> receives key events and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#event-type-beforeinput">beforeinput</a>
                        event as specified in [[uievents]].
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    There are also some ways that an <a>EditContext editing host</a>
                    differs from other types of [=editing hosts=]:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When the {{Document}} being edited has an [=active EditContext=], the user agent must not update the DOM
                        as a direct result of a user action in the <a>EditContext editing host</a>
                        (e.g., keyboard input in an editable region, deleting or formatting text, ...).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the {{Document}} being edited has an [=active EditContext=], the user agent must not fire the
                        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#event-type-input">input</a> event
                        against the <a>EditContext editing host</a> as a direct result of user action
                        event as specified in [[uievents]].
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h4>EditContext events</h4>
            <p>
                The user agent fires several types of events against the {{EditContext}} in order to
                inform the author when they must update the state of the DOM in response to changes
                from the [=Text Input Service=], or respond to a query from the [=Text Input Service=].
                Since the timings of [=Text Input Service=]s are platform-specific, authors should
                avoid taking dependencies on the timing of these events.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The user agent must fire {{TextUpdateEvent}} when the [=Text Input Service=] indicates
                    that the user has made changes to the text, the selection, or the composition range
                    properties of the EditContext. When the author receives this event, they must render
                    the changes back to the page's view so the user can see what they are typing.

                    the author receives this event, they must render the formatting change back to

                        to support the [=Text Input Method=] in properly displaying its user interface.
                        After receiving {{CharacterBoundsUpdateEvent}}, the author must compute the
                        requested character bounds and call {{EditContext/updateCharacterBounds}} to
                        update the character bounds in the EditContext's [=text state=]. The author
                        should perform the {{EditContext/updateCharacterBounds}} call synchronously
                        within the {{CharacterBoundsUpdateEvent}} event handler if possible; if not,
                        it is permissible to call it asynchronously.
                        Upon receiving {{EditContext/updateCharacterBounds}}, the user agent must
                        pass the character bounds information on to the [=Text Input Service=].

                <h4>Examples</h4>
                <p>Using an {{EditContext}}, an author can mark a region of the document editable by <a data-lt="associated element">associating</a> an {{EditContext}} object with an element as shown in the example below: </p>
                <aside class="example" title="Associate an EditContext with an Element">
                    <pre><xmp><script type="module"> 
        let canvas = document.querySelector("canvas") 
        canvas.editContext = new EditContext() 
        // When the associated element is focused, the EditContext is automatically activated.
        canvas.focus();
    </script>
    <canvas></canvas></xmp></pre></aside>

                <p>In the example below, the author is using a canvas to draw an editable region that allows the user to input a single line of text rendered with a monospace font.  The text for the editable region is maintained by the author as a String.  The text offsets for the selection in the editable region are maintained by the author as a pair of Numbers: selectionStart and selectionEnd.  The Numbers refer to the count of the number of UTF-16 codepoints to the left of the start and end of the selection respectively.  For the sake of communicating the bounding boxes for the current selection and the editable region of the document to Text Input Services, the author also computes the bounding rectangle in CSS pixels for the selection and the editable region of the document. The offset of the rectangle is expressed relative to the origin of the canvas element since that is the element to which the author has <a data-lt="associated element">associated</a> an EditContext. Since the model for the author’s representation of text and selection location matches the form expected by the EditContext API, the author can simply assign those properties to the EditContext <a data-lt="associated element">associated</a> with the canvas whenever those values change. </p>
