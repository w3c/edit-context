        <section id="background">
            <h3>Background and Motivation</h3>
            <p>Modern operating systems provide mechanisms to produce text in a variety of ways: speech-to-text, virtual keyboards, handwriting recognition and many more.  When an app wants to consume text input from these various sources, it must first provide a view of its currently editable text to the operating system.  The view of editable text provides a common language that apps (having a variety of different document models) and sources of text (having a variety of different input methods) can both understand.  Both the apps and input sources communicate with one another by expressing their desired changes to the state of the common view as an event that the other can handle to facilitate the text input process.</p>
            <p>For the purposes of this document, a producer of text is known as a <dfn>Text Input Method</dfn>.  The view provided by an app which wants to consume text is called a <dfn>Text Edit Context</dfn>.  The service provided by the OS to facilitate the editing of text in the [=Text Edit Context=] by the [=Text Input Methods=] is called a <dfn>Text Input Service</dfn>.</p>
            <figure id="many-input-methods">
                <img src="images/many-input-methods.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>Many [=Text Input Methods=] using a [=Text Input Service=] to communicate with many apps through their [=Text Edit Contexts=].</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Here’s a typical flow for the text input process in more detail:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>A user places focus into an editable region of the app.</li>
                <li>The app produces a [=Text Edit Context=] describing its editable region according to the standards set forth by the [=Text Input Service=] and provides that [=Text Edit Context=] to the [=Text Input Service=].</li>
                <li>The [=Text Input Service=] triggers a [=Text Input Method=] to provide some user interface for capturing text input from the user and provides the [=Text Input Method=] the app generated [=Text Edit Context=].</li>
                <li>The [=Text Input Method=] reads the location of selection and nearby text from the [=Text Edit Context=] to help tailor its user experience.</li>
                <li>The [=Text Input Method=] may also read screen coordinates for where the selection and editable region are located so that it can properly position its user interface next to the text being edited.</li>
                <li>The user interacts with the [=Text Input Method=] user interface to input text in some [=Text Input Method=]-specific way.</li>
                <li>The [=Text Input Method=] describes its desired modifications to the text and selection in the [=Text Edit Context=] in response to the user’s input.</li>
                <li>The app handles an event describing the desired modifications to its [=Text Edit Context=] and renders the result to the user.</li>
            </ol>
            <figure id="text-input-process">
                <img src="images/text-input-process.jpg" alt="">
                <figcaption>A sequence diagram illustrating a typical flow for text input.</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>Existing user agents handle the details of this text input process so that the author’s responsibility ends at declaring what elements of the document represent an editable region.  Authors express which regions are editable using input elements, textarea elements, contenteditable elements, or by setting the designMode attribute to true to mark an entire document as editable. </p>
            <p>As an editable region of the document is <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focused">focused</a>, the user agent automatically produces the [=Text Edit Context=] from the contents of the editable region and the position of the selection within it.  When a [=Text Input Method=] produces text, the user agent translates the events against its [=Text Edit Context=] into a set of DOM and style modifications – only some of which are described using existing events that an author can handle. </p>
            <p>Authors that want to produce sophisticated editing experiences may be challenged by the current approach.  If, for example, the text and selection are rendered to a canvas, user agents are unable to produce a [=Text Edit Context=] to drive the text input process.  Authors compensate by resorting to offscreen editable elements, but this approach comes with negative implications for accessibility, it deteriorates the input experience, and requires complex code to synchronize the position of the text in the offscreen editable element with the corresponding text in the canvas. </p>
            <p>With the introduction of this EditContext API, authors can more directly participate in the protocol for text input and avoid the pitfalls described above.</p>

            <h3>The EditContext Model</h3>
            <p>
                The [=Text Input Service=] and [=Text Edit Context=] are abstractions representing the common aspects of text input across many operating systems.
                An {{EditContext}} is a JavaScript reflection of the [=Text Edit Context=]. 
                When changes are made to the [=Text Edit Context=] by the [=Text Input Service=], those changes are reflected to the author asynchronously in the form of events which are dispatched against the [=active EditContext=].
                When the author makes changes to the [=active EditContext=], those changes will be reflected in the [=Text Edit Context=] during the next lifecycle update.
            </p>
            <p>
                To reflect changes made by the author to the [=active EditContext=] since the last lifecycle update, run the steps to [=update the Text Edit Context=] 
                with the [=active EditContext=]'s [=text state=]'s [=text=], [=selection start=], [=selection end=], [=control bounds=], [=selection bounds=], and [=codepoint locations=].
            </p>
            <p>
                When the [=Text Input Service=] updates the state of the [=Text Edit Context=], run the steps to [=update the EditContext=] 
                with the [=Text Edit Context=]'s [=text state=]'s [=text=], [=text formats=], [=selection start=], [=selection end=], [=is composing=], [=composition start=], and [=composition end=].
            </p>
            <h4>EditContext state</h4>
            <p>
                Both the [=Text Edit Context=] and {{EditContext}} have a [=text state=] which holds the information exchanged in the aforementioned updates. The <dfn>text state</dfn> consists of:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><dfn>text</dfn> which is a {{DOMString}} representing editable content. The initial value is the empty string.</li>
                <li><dfn>selection start</dfn> which refers to the offset in [=text=] where the selection starts. The initial value is 0.</li>
                <li><dfn>selection end</dfn> which refers to the offset in [=text=] where the selection ends. The initial value is 0. [=selection end=] must always be greater than or equal to [=selection start=].</li>
                <li><dfn>is composing</dfn> which indicates if there is an active composition. The initial value is false.</li>
                <li><dfn>composition start</dfn> which refers to the offset in [=text=] representing the start position of the text being actively composed. The initial value is 0.</p></li>
                <li><dfn>composition end</dfn> which refers to the offset in [=text=] representing the end position of the text being actively composed. The initial value is 0. [=composition end=] must always be greater than or equal to [=composition start=].</li>
                <li><dfn>text formats</dfn> which is an array of [=text format=]. The array is initially empty.</li>
                <li><dfn>control bounds</dfn> is a rectangle describing the area of the screen in which [=text=] is displayed.  It is in the [=client coordinate=] system and the initial x, y, width, and height all 0.</li>
                <li><dfn>selection bounds</dfn> is the rectangle describing the position of selection. It is in the [=client coordinate=] system and the initial x, y, width, and height are all 0.</li>
                <li><dfn>codepoint locations</dfn> which is an array of [=codepoint location=]. The array is initially empty.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><dfn>text format</dfn> is a struct that indicates decorative properties that should be applied to the ranges of [=text=].  The struct contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><dfn>rangeStart</dfn> which is an offset into [=text=] that respresents the position before the first codepoint that should be decorated.</li>
                <li><dfn>rangeEnd</dfn> which is an offset into [=text=] that respresents the position after the last codepoint that should be decorated.</li>
                <li><dfn>textColor</dfn> which is the prefered color of the decorated [=text=] range. The value is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#serializing-sRGB-values">serialized sRGB values</a>.</li>
                <li><dfn>backgroundColor</dfn> which is the prefered background color of the decorated [=text=] range. The value is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#serializing-sRGB-values">serialized sRGB values</a>.</li>
                <li><dfn>underlineStyle</dfn> which is the prefered underline style of the decorated [=text=] range. The value is one of the following strings: "none", "solid", "double", "dotted", "dashed", and "wavy". </li>
                <li><dfn>underlineThickness</dfn> which is the prefered underline thickness of the decorated [=text=] range. The value is one of the following strings: "none", "thin", and "thick"</li>
                <li><dfn>underlineColor</dfn> which is the prefered underline color of the decorated [=text=] range. The value is a <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#serializing-sRGB-values">serialized sRGB values</a>.</li>
            </ul>
            <p><dfn>codepoint location</dfn> is a struct that captures the location (in [=client coordinate=]s) of codepoints from [=text=].  Each struct represents a contigious run of codepoints starting at an offset within [=text=] indicated by [=start index=].  The struct contains:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><dfn>start index</dfn> which is an offset into [=text=] that respresents the position before the first codepoint whose location is reported by the first member of [=codepoint rects=] array.</li>
                <li><dfn>codepoint rects</dfn> is an array of {{DOMRect}} defining the bounding box of each codepoint.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="note">
                [=Codepoint locations=] provides the means for the user agent to query multiple ranges of [=text=] for positioning information.
                Different platforms may require different positions to be cached to fulfill queries from the [=Text Input Service=] and this API shape allows for that flexibility.
                It would be good if the API could be simplified to require just the positions of the actively composed text along with the [=selection bounds=] and [=control bounds=].
                Exploration is needed to see if that is possible.
            </p>
            <p>In addition to [=text state=], an {{EditContext}} also has:
            <ul>
                <li><dfn>dirty flag</dfn> which is initially false, but set true by any steps which allow the author to update the state of the {{EditContext}}.</li>
                <li><dfn>character bounds updated flag</dfn> which is initially false.</li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Association and activation</h4>
            <p>
                An {{EditContext}} has an <dfn data-for="edit-context">associated element</dfn>, an {{HTMLElement}}.
                An element becomes an {{EditContext}}'s <a>associated element </a>by assigning
                the {{EditContext}} to the element's {{HTMLElement/editContext}} property.
                An {{HTMLElement}} can be <a data-lt="associated element">associated</a> with at most one {{EditContext}}.
            </p>
            <p class="issue">
                Should we enable authors to <a data-lt="associated element">associate</a> an {{EditContext}} with multiple elements?
                This could be useful for multipage editing scenarios where different pages are represented by different elements in the DOM.
            </p>
            <p>
                The definition of an [=editing host=] will be modified so that an {{EditContext}}'s
                <a>associated element</a> is also an [=editing host=], unless that element's parent is
                <a href="https://w3c.github.io/editing/docs/execCommand/#editable">editable</a>.
                As such, the element will receive the behaviors of an [=editing host=] that are defined
                in other specifications, except where noted in [[[#edit-context-differences]]].

                <p>A user agent should have at most one <dfn>active EditContext</dfn>.  An {{EditContext}} is active when its <a>associated element</a>, or a descendant of its <a>associated element</a>, is <a href="https://html.spec.whatwg.org/multipage/interaction.html#focused">focused</a>.</p>
                <p>When an {{EditContext}} meets the criteria above, it must be made the [=active EditContext=] by running the steps to [=activate an EditContext=].</p>
                <p>If an element <a data-lt="associated element">associated</a> with an [=active EditContext=] no longer meets the criteria outlined above, run the steps to [=deactivate an EditContext=].</p>
                
                <p>When there is an [=active EditContext=] and there is a text input from the [=Text Input Service=], the user agent must run [=Update the EditContext=].</p>
            </p>
            <h4 id="edit-context-differences">Differences for an EditContext editing host</h4>
            <p>
                <p>
                    In many ways, an [=editing host=] that's <a data-lt="associated element">associated</a> with an {{EditContext}}
                    behaves in the same way as an [=editing host=] for a [^html-global/contenteditable^] element. Notable similarities include:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Each child node of the [=editing host=] becomes <a href="https://w3c.github.io/editing/docs/execCommand/#editable">editable</a>,
                        unless that node has a 	[^html-global/contenteditable^] attribute set to "<code>false</code>".
                    </li>
                    <li>The user agent handles focus and caret navigation for any editable element in the [=editing host=].</li>
                    <li>
                        The [=editing host=] receives key events and the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#event-type-beforeinput">beforeinput</a>
                        event as specified in [[uievents]].
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>
                    There are also some ways that an [=editing host=] that's <a data-lt="associated element">associated</a> with an {{EditContext}}
                    differs from other [=editing hosts=]:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When there is an [=active EditContext=], the user agent must not update the DOM
                        as a direct result of a user action in the [=editing host=]
                        (e.g., keyboard input in an editable region, deleting or formatting text, ...).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When there is an [=active EditContext=], the user agent must not fire the
                        <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/uievents/#event-type-input">input</a> event
                        against the [=editing host=] as a direct result of user action
                        event as specified in [[uievents]].
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p class="note">
                    Given these differences, [=Editing host=] may not be the best term to use to describe the
                    impact of </a data-lt="associated element">associating</a> an {{EditContext}} with an {{HTMLElement}}.
                    If the complexity of managing these differences outweighs the convenience of having the concepts grouped together,
                    we can perform a split into two types of [=editing hosts=].
                </p>
            </p>
            
            <h4>EditContext events</h4>
            <p>
                The user agent fires several types of events against the {{EditContext}} in order to
                inform the author when they must update the state of the DOM in response to changes
                from the [=Text Input Service=], or respond to a query from the [=Text Input Service=].
                Since the timings of [=Text Input Service=]s are platform-specific, authors should
                avoid taking dependencies on the timing of these events.
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The user agent must fire {{TextUpdateEvent}} when the [=Text Input Service=] indicates
                    that the user has made changes to the text, the selection, or the composition range
                    properties of the EditContext. When the author receives this event, they must render
                    the changes back to the page's view so the user can see what they are typing.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The user agent must fire {{TextFormatUpdateEvent}} when the [=Text Input Service=]
                    indicates that certain formats should be applied to the text being composed. When

                    the page's view to aid the user with their IME composition.</li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        The user agent must fire {{CharacterBoundsUpdateEvent}} when the
                        [=Text Input Service=] indicates that it requires character bounds information
                        to support the [=Text Input Method=] in properly displaying its user interface.
                        After receiving {{CharacterBoundsUpdateEvent}}, the author must compute the
                        requested character bounds and call {{EditContext/updateCharacterBounds}} to
                        update the character bounds in the EditContext's [=text state=]. The author
                        should perform the {{EditContext/updateCharacterBounds}} call synchronously
                        within the {{CharacterBoundsUpdateEvent}} event handler if possible; if not,
                        it is permissible to call it asynchronously.
                        Upon receiving {{EditContext/updateCharacterBounds}}, the user agent must
                        pass the character bounds information on to the [=Text Input Service=].
                    </p>
                    <p class="note">
                        The longer the author delays the {{EditContext/updateCharacterBounds}} call,
                        the higher the likelihood that the user will observe a visual stutter as the
                        IME window repositions itself in the middle of a composition.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </ul>
            <h4>Examples</h4>
            <p>Using an {{EditContext}}, an author can mark a region of the document editable by <a data-lt="associated element">associating</a> an {{EditContext}} object with an element as shown in the example below: </p>
            <aside class="example" title="Associate an EditContext with an Element">
                <pre><xmp><script type="module"> 
    let canvas = document.querySelector("canvas") 
    canvas.editContext = new EditContext() 
    // When the associated element is focused, the EditContext is automatically activated.
    canvas.focus();
</script>
<canvas></canvas></xmp></pre></aside>

            <p>In the example below, the author is using a canvas to draw an editable region that allows the user to input a single line of text rendered with a monospace font.  The text for the editable region is maintained by the author as a String.  The text offsets for the selection in the editable region are maintained by the author as a pair of Numbers: selectionStart and selectionEnd.  The Numbers refer to the count of the number of UTF-16 codepoints to the left of the start and end of the selection respectively.  For the sake of communicating the bounding boxes for the current selection and the editable region of the document to Text Input Services, the author also computes the bounding rectangle in CSS pixels for the selection and the editable region of the document. The offset of the rectangle is expressed relative to the origin of the canvas element since that is the element to which the author has <a data-lt="associated element">associated</a> an EditContext. Since the model for the author’s representation of text and selection location matches the form expected by the EditContext API, the author can simply assign those properties to the EditContext <a data-lt="associated element">associated</a> with the canvas whenever those values change. </p>

                Should attachedElements() return elements that are removed from the tree? If yes, the EditContext will keep removed elements alive. If not, we probably shouldn't allow a disconnected element to <a data-lt="associated element">associate</a> with EditContext, otherwise, it would be confusing/unintuitive that we allow it but attachedElements returns empty.
